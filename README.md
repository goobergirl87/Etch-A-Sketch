# Etch-A-Sketch

Compared to Rock, paper, scissors Etch-a-sketch felt on one side easy, but on the other also not. But besides facing new problems, I had the feeling that the gained knowledge had sunken deeper into my braincells. I was starting to go to bed thinking about how to solve a problem and waking up with ideas. The main focus of this project lies on DOM manipulation. Staying focused and mapping out the problems is still my biggest challenge. And writing that down is actually also helpful itself.

The combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript tickled me again in the most satisfying way. I know Iâ€™m far away from being a professional coder, but this project was just a delight.
